#when strain exceeds 70% alert user
#When strain exceeds 90% ask user if they wish to continue
#If yes continue monitoring, if no, restrart system
#When strain exceeds 95% alert user that the canary has died and shutdown system
#Intended to protect system from longterm damage, also just a gimmick program
